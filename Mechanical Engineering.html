	<h3>Injection moulding a Stopcock Valve</h3>
	<h6>Spring 2020</h6>
	<p>The ultimate goal of the project is to design a stopcock valve with dynamic rotary O-Ring and a molding device that injection-molds the parts.</p>
	<p>In order to calculate proper dimensions of the stopcock, study on O-Ring was preceded. Inner/outer diameters and materials of the O-Ring with careful analysis on the operating condition was first specified. Then the overall design of the stopcock was determined accordingly.</p>
	<p>Since the part was designed to be injection-molded, modifications were made to facilitate the process. Redundant materials inside were removed to minimize the distortion that can be caused by the uneven heat distribution, and small amount of chamfer was added to the sides so that the parts can be ejected easily from the molding device.</p>
	<p>The stopcock valve was designed as two parts that will be molded separately, since ultrasonic welding was considered as a suitable method to weld the parts without delaying the overall process significantly. One part has tongue and another groove so that they can be welded tight. Energy director that concentrates the vibrational energy was also included.</p>
	<p>The cast was fabricated which was installed into the injection mold assembly. </p>
	<p>The project was finalized by simulating the possible load application to make sure that the part won't fail during normal operating condition. Also the time required to fill the mold was simulated to make sure that the molten plastic won't stop short while being injected</p>
	<p>Onshape was used to design the stopcock and the mold parts, and Solidworks was used to implement the Von-Mises stress analysis and plastic injection simulation.</p>

	<h3>Beam Deflection Lab</h3>
	<h6>Spring 2020</h6>
	<p>The purpose of this lab is to determine the modulus of elasticity of a cantilever beam by measuring the deflection of the beam due to the weight hung at one end.</p>
	<p>Strain gauge and micrometer was installed to the beam so that the strain and deflection can be measured as the weight is increased. Strain and deflection were then each plotted as a function of weight, whose slope was used to calculate the modulus of elasticity of the material.</p>
