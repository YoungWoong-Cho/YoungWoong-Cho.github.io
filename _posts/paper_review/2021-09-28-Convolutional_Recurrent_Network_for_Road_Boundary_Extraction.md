> Extraction of drivable road boundary is important for self-driving cars. In this paper, the authors propose a convolutional recurrent network that extracts the road boundary from LiDAR and camera images.

## Preliminary
Before we begin, prepare **a cup of coffee** that will help us through the paper.
