# Week 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Class 5: Introduction to Inheritance

### Understanding Inheritance

In Week 2, we explored the concept of classes and objects in Java. This week, we delve into a powerful concept called **inheritance**. Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes and methods. It's a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.

#### The Base Class (Superclass)

- A class from which other classes inherit is called the **base class** or **superclass**.
- It contains common attributes and methods shared by its subclasses.

#### Subclasses (Derived Classes)

- Classes that inherit from a superclass are known as **subclasses** or **derived classes**.
- Subclasses inherit the attributes and methods of the superclass.
- They can also have their own additional attributes and methods.

#### Why Use Inheritance?

- **Code Reusability**: Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing you to define common functionality in a superclass.
- **Hierarchy**: It helps create a hierarchy of classes, where more specific classes inherit from more general ones.

### Creating Subclasses

Let's see how to create subclasses in Java.

```java
// Superclass (Base Class)
class Animal {
    String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    void speak() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

// Subclass (Derived Class)
class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) {
        super(name); // Call the superclass constructor
    }

    // Overriding the speak method
    @Override
    void speak() {
        System.out.println(name + " barks");
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a superclass `Animal` with an attribute `name` and a method `speak`. We then create a subclass `Dog` that inherits from `Animal` and overrides the `speak` method.

### Using Inherited and Overridden Methods

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Animal("Generic Animal");
        Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");

        animal.speak(); // Output: Animal makes a sound
        dog.speak();    // Output: Buddy barks
    }
}
```

In the `Main` class, we create objects of both `Animal` and `Dog` classes. Notice how the `speak` method behaves differently in the `Dog` subclass.

### The `super` Keyword

- The `super` keyword is used to call the superclass constructor or access superclass methods and attributes.
- It is useful when you want to extend the behavior of the superclass's method.

```java
// In the Dog class
void printDetails() {
    System.out.println("Name: " + name);
    super.speak(); // Call the speak method of the superclass
}
```

## Class 6: Polymorphism and Method Overloading

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is another essential concept in object-oriented programming. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables flexibility and extensibility in your code.

#### Types of Polymorphism

1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism**: This occurs at compile time and is also known as **method overloading**. It involves using the same method name with different parameters.

2. **Run-Time Polymorphism**: This occurs at runtime and is also known as **method overriding**. It involves a subclass providing a specific implementation for a method inherited from the superclass.

### Method Overloading

Method overloading, a form of compile-time polymorphism, allows you to define multiple methods with the same name in a class. However, these methods must have different parameter lists (different types or different numbers of parameters).

#### Example of Method Overloading

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    String add(String a, String b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `add` method is overloaded three times with different parameter types (int, double, String).

### Using Method Overloading

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

        int sumInt = calculator.add(5, 7);
        double sumDouble = calculator.add(3.14, 2.71);
        String concatenated = calculator.add("Hello, ", "world!");

        System.out.println("Sum (int): " + sumInt);
        System.out.println("Sum (double): " + sumDouble);
        System.out.println("Concatenated String: " + concatenated);
    }
}
```

In this `Main` class, we create an instance of the `Calculator` class and call the `add` method with different parameter types. The appropriate overloaded method is selected based on the arguments provided.

### Homework

1. Create a superclass `Shape` with attributes `color` and `area`. Define a method `calculateArea` that sets the area to 0.0 and a method `displayInfo` that displays the color and area.
2. Create two subclasses, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, that inherit from `Shape`. Implement methods in the subclasses to calculate and set their respective areas.
3. Create instances of `Circle` and `Rectangle`, calculate and display their areas, and specify colors for each shape.
