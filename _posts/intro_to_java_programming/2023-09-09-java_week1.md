# Week 1: Introduction to Java and Basic Programming Concepts

## Class 1: Introduction to Programming and Java

### What is Programming?
Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. Computers understand instructions in the form of code, which is written in programming languages like Java.

### Introduction to Java
Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language with its own set of strengths and weaknesses compared to other languages. When to use Java depends on your project's requirements and goals. Below are some of the pros and cons of Java:

#### Pros of Java:

* **Platform Independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere)**: Java applications can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which makes it highly portable. This is a significant advantage for cross-platform development.

* **Strong Object-Oriented Language**: Java enforces strong object-oriented programming principles, making it suitable for building modular and maintainable code.

* **Rich Standard Library**: Java offers a vast standard library that includes classes and methods for a wide range of functionalities. This can significantly speed up development and reduce the need for reinventing the wheel.

* **Memory Management**: Java has built-in automatic memory management (garbage collection), which helps prevent memory leaks and simplifies memory management for developers.

* **Multi-Threading and Concurrency**: Java provides built-in support for multi-threading, allowing developers to create concurrent and responsive applications.

#### Cons of Java:

* **Performance**: While Java has improved over the years, it may still be less performant than some lower-level languages like C or C++. However, modern JVMs have made significant performance enhancements.

* **Verbosity**: Java code can be verbose, requiring more lines of code compared to some other languages for accomplishing similar tasks.

* **Learning Curve**: For beginners, Java's strict syntax and object-oriented concepts may present a steeper learning curve compared to some dynamically-typed languages.

#### When to Use Java:

* **Android App Development**: Java was traditionally one of the primary languages for Android app development. However, Kotlin has gained popularity in recent years and is now the preferred language for Android.

* **Big Data and Cloud Computing**: Java is commonly used in big data and cloud computing frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, and AWS Lambda.

* **Web Development**: Java can be used for server-side web development with frameworks like Spring, JavaServer Faces (JSF), and Apache Struts.

### Setting up the Java Development Environment
To start writing Java code, you need to set up the development environment. Follow these steps:
1. Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK).
2. Install a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code.

### Writing and Running a Simple "Hello World" Program
In Java, a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen looks like this:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- `public class HelloWorld`: Defines a class named HelloWorld.
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the main method where the program starts execution.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`: Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Exercise
Write a Java program that prints your name to the console.

## Class 2: Variables and Data Types

### Variables
- Variables are used to store data in a program.
- In Java, you must declare a variable with a specific data type before using it.
- There are two main categories of data types in Java: primitive data types and reference (object) data types.

### Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types represent single values and are built into the Java language. They are simple and provide better performance because they store the actual value, not a reference to an object. Here are some commonly used primitive data types:

1. `int`: Represents integer numbers (e.g., 42). It can store whole numbers, both positive and negative.

2. `double`: Represents floating-point numbers with decimal places (e.g., 3.1415). It's used for numbers with fractional parts.

3. `char`: Represents single characters (e.g., 'A'). It stores a single Unicode character.

4. `boolean`: Represents true or false values. It's used for conditions and logic (e.g., `true` or `false`).

### Example:
```java
int age = 25;
double pi = 3.1415;
char grade = 'A';
boolean isJavaFun = true;
```

### Reference (Object) Data Types
Reference data types do not store the actual data but store references (memory addresses) to objects in memory. They are more complex and versatile than primitive data types. One of the most commonly used reference data types is:

1. `String`: Represents a sequence of characters (e.g., "Hello"). It is implemented as an object in Java and provides various methods for working with strings.

### Example:
```java
String greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

When you create a `String` object, Java allocates memory to store the character sequence and provides methods to manipulate it. Other reference data types include arrays, classes, and user-defined objects.

Understanding the difference between primitive and reference data types is essential when working with Java, as it affects memory usage, performance, and the way you interact with data in your programs.

> Memory allocation and management in Java are automatic and handled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Let's explore how memory is utilized in Java, including the concept of the byte unit and the sizes of various data types in bytes.

**Primitive data types** are used to represent simple values, and they directly store the actual value in memory. They are typically used for basic data such as numbers and characters. Here are some common primitive data types and their sizes in bytes:

* `byte` (8 bits or 1 byte): Represents small integers from -128 to 127.
* `short` (16 bits or 2 bytes): Represents small integers from -32,768 to 32,767.
* `int` (32 bits or 4 bytes): Represents integers from approximately -2 billion to 2 billion.
* `long` (64 bits or 8 bytes): Represents large integers.
* `float` (32 bits or 4 bytes): Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.
* `double` (64 bits or 8 bytes): Represents double-precision floating-point numbers.
* `char` (16 bits or 2 bytes): Represents a single Unicode character.
* `boolean` (size not strictly defined): Represents true or false values.

**Reference data types** store references (memory addresses) to objects in memory, rather than the actual data itself. They are used for more complex and user-defined data structures. The size of a reference data type variable is consistent, regardless of the size of the object it refers to. Common reference data types include:

* `String`: Represents a sequence of characters.
* `Arrays`: Ordered collections of elements of the same or different data types.
Custom classes and objects: User-defined data types.

### Exercise
Write a Java program that declares and initializes variables of different data types (both primitive and reference) and performs operations on them, such as arithmetic calculations or string manipulations.

Explanation:
- We import the `Scanner` class.
- Create a `Scanner` object to read input.
- `nextLine()` reads a line of text entered by the user.
- We close the scanner to free up resources.

### Exercise
Write a Java program that takes the user's age as input and prints a message based on whether they are a minor or an adult.
