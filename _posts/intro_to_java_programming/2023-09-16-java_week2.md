# Week 2: Classes and Objects

## Class 3: Introduction to Classes and Objects

### Understanding Classes and Objects

In Week 1, we introduced you to the basics of Java programming. Now, in Week 2, we'll dive deeper into the core of Java - classes and objects. Understanding classes and objects is fundamental to object-oriented programming (OOP).

#### What is a Class?

- A **class** is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.
- It defines the structure and behavior of objects that will be created based on it.
- A class encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods) that objects of that class will have.

#### What is an Object?

- An **object** is an instance of a class.
- Objects are created based on the class blueprint.
- Each object has its own unique data and can perform actions defined in the class.

### Creating Custom Classes

Now, let's see how to create our own classes in Java.

```java
public class Car {
    // Instance variables (attributes)
    String brand;
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String brand, String model, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method to display car information
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand);
        System.out.println("Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
    }
}
```

In this example, we've defined a `Car` class with attributes (`brand`, `model`, `year`) and a constructor to initialize these attributes. We also have a `displayInfo` method to print car information.

### Creating Objects

Let's create objects of the `Car` class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating car objects
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
        Car car2 = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2021);

        // Calling the displayInfo method
        car1.displayInfo();
        car2.displayInfo();
    }
}
```

In this example, we've created two `Car` objects (`car1` and `car2`) and called the `displayInfo` method to display their information.

### Instance Variables and Methods

- **Instance variables** (attributes) store data specific to each object.
- **Methods** define the behavior of objects.

#### Accessing Instance Variables and Methods

You can access instance variables and methods using the dot notation:

```java
car1.brand = "Ford"; // Updating the brand attribute
car1.displayInfo(); // Calling the displayInfo method
```

### Homework

1. Create a class named `Student` with attributes `name`, `age`, and `major`. Include a constructor and a method to display student information.
2. Create two `Student` objects and display their information.

## Class 4: Constructors, Access Modifiers, and Method Overloading

### Constructors

In the previous class, we learned about creating custom classes and objects. Now, let's explore constructors, access modifiers, and method overloading to enhance our understanding of classes and objects.

#### What is a Constructor?

- A **constructor** is a special method that is called when an object is created.
- It is used to initialize the object's attributes and perform any setup needed.

#### Default Constructor

If you don't provide a constructor for your class, Java automatically provides a **default constructor** with no arguments. However, you can create your own constructors to customize object initialization.

```java
public class Student {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Default constructor
    public Student() {
        name = "Unknown";
        age = 0;
    }
}
```

#### Parameterized Constructor

You can create **parameterized constructors** to allow for custom initialization when creating objects.

```java
public class Student {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Student(String n, int a) {
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }
}
```

### Access Modifiers

Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods). There are four types of access modifiers in Java:

- **public**: The member is accessible from any other class.
- **private**: The member is only accessible within the same class.
- **protected**: The member is accessible within the same class and its subclasses.
- **default (no modifier)**: The member is accessible only within the same package.

```java
public class Person {
    public String name;
    private int age;
    protected String address;
    String email; // Default access modifier
}
```

### Method Overloading

**Method overloading** allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. The compiler determines which method to call based on the number and types of arguments.

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

In this example, we have two `add` methodsâ€”one for integers and one for doubles. Java will choose the appropriate method based on the argument types.

### Homework

1. Create a class named `Book` with attributes `title`, `author`, and `year`. Include both default and parameterized constructors. Also, create a method to display book information.
2. Overload the method to display book information so that it can handle books with or without an author.

That's it for Class 4! Next, we'll explore more advanced concepts, including inheritance and polymorphism.
