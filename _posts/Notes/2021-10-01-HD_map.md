**High definition map** is a roadmap with accuracy level down to centimeter scales. It contains important information of the static part of the scene, such as drivable area, lane lines, crosswalks, stoplines, etc. They are extremely important for the tasks such ad perception, path planning, and localization.

However, annotating HD maps is an awfully laborious task. Imagine labeling tens of millions of points that correspond to the exact position of the curb, lanes, crosswalks, and so forth. Hence, there have been numerous efforts to automate the map construction process.
