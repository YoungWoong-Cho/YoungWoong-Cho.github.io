title:  "Decay - A CycleGAN Project"

> Our project began with a question, *"what if inorganic things **'decay'**, like organic things?"*

## Decay, in Biology
The word **decay** nearly instinctively gives a negative impression, because it is usually associated with death. After an organic body goes through death, it biodegrades, or less formally, decays. The decomposers break down the organic body, changing it into an inorganic matter. The mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of the dead body change as it decays.
