# Introduction to Backend development

<details>
<summary>Node.js and Express.js</summary>

## Introduction to Node.js
### Definition and Purpose
**Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript code to be executed outside the browser, making it suitable for **server-side development**. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which provides high performance and scalability.

### Advantages of Node.js
1. Asynchronous and Non-Blocking: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, enabling it to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently. This makes it well-suited for applications with high concurrency, such as real-time chat applications.
2. Single Language: With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript on both the frontend and backend, promoting code reuse and enabling full-stack development by the same team.
3. Large Ecosystem: Node.js has a vast collection of open-source libraries and packages available through npm (Node Package Manager), providing developers with a wide range of tools and modules for various functionalities.

## Introduction to Express.js
### Definition and Purpose
**Express.js** is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications by providing a set of features and utilities.

### Advantages of Express.js
1. Minimalistic and Flexible: Express.js is a minimal and unopinionated framework, allowing developers to structure applications according to their preferences.
2. Middleware: Express.js leverages middleware functions to handle various aspects of HTTP requests and responses, such as logging, authentication, and error handling.
3. Routing: Express.js provides a simple and intuitive way to define routes for handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URL patterns.

## Creating a Simple Node.js and Express.js Server
### Setting Up a Project
1. Create a new directory for the project.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal or command prompt.

### Initialize a New Node.js Project
- Run `npm init` and follow the prompts to create a package.json file with project details.

### Install Express.js
- Run `npm install express` to install the Express.js package in the project.

### Create a Simple Server
- Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `app.js`) in the project directory.
- Import Express.js and create an instance of the application.
- Define a route to handle HTTP GET requests to the root path ('/') and send a response.
- Start the server and listen on a specified port.

Example:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Run the Server
- In the terminal, run `node app.js` to start the Node.js server with Express.js.

### Access the Server
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (assuming the server is running on port 3000). You should see the message "Hello, Express!" displayed.

## Exploring Middleware in Express.js
### Middleware Functions
- **Middleware functions** are functions that have access to the request (req) and response (res) objects in Express.js. They can execute code, modify request or response objects, and pass control to the next middleware or route handler.
- Common use cases for middleware include logging, authentication, data parsing, error handling, and more.

### Adding Middleware to Express.js
- Middleware can be added globally to all routes or specific to certain routes.
- Use the `app.use()` method to apply middleware globally, and the `app.METHOD()` methods (e.g., `app.get()`, `app.post()`) to apply middleware to specific routes.

Example (Logging Middleware):
```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`Request received: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next();
});
```

## Advanced Routing in Express.js
### Express Router
- **Express.js** allows you to organize routes using an Express Router. It provides a cleaner and more modular approach to handling routes in larger applications.

Example:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.send('Hello, from the router!');
});

app.use('/api', router); // Mount the router at the /api path

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Route Parameters
- Express.js supports route parameters, allowing you to define dynamic parts in the URL. Route parameters are denoted by a colon followed by the parameter name.

Example:
```javascript
app.get('/users/:userId', (req, res) => {
const userId = req.params.userId;
res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});
```

<summary>python flask</summary>

## Introduction to Python Flask
### Definition and Purpose
Flask is a lightweight and flexible web application framework written in Python. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, allowing developers to build web applications quickly and efficiently.

### Advantages of Python Flask
1. Minimalistic and Unopinionated: Flask follows a minimalistic design philosophy, giving developers the freedom to structure applications as they prefer without imposing rigid conventions.
2. Extensible and Modular: Flask allows developers to add third-party extensions and libraries to enhance functionality, making it highly modular and scalable.
3. Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, which allows developers to test and run applications locally during development.

### Setting Up Python Flask
1. Installation: Flask can be installed using pip, the Python package manager. Run pip install Flask in the terminal or command prompt to install Flask.
2. Verification: After installation, verify that Flask is correctly installed by running a simple "Hello, Flask!" application.

## Creating a Simple Flask Server
### Setting Up a Project
1. Create a new directory for the project.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal or command prompt.

### Create a Simple Flask Application
- Create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) in the project directory.
- Import Flask and create an instance of the application.
- Define a route to handle HTTP GET requests to the root path ('/') and send a response.
- Start the server and run the application.

Example:
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, Flask!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Run the Flask Server
- In the terminal, run `python app.py` to start the Flask server.

## Access the Server
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (assuming the server is running on the default port 5000). You should see the message "Hello, Flask!" displayed.

## Exploring Routing and URL Parameters in Flask
### Routing in Flask
- Flask uses the @app.route() decorator to define routes and associate them with route handlers (view functions).

Example:
```python
@app.route('/greet/<name>')
def greet(name):
    return f'Hello, {name}!'
```

### URL Parameters in Flask
- Flask supports URL parameters denoted by angle brackets `<param_name>` in the route URL. These parameters are extracted and made available in the route handler as arguments.

Example:
```python
@app.route('/user/<int:user_id>')
def get_user(user_id):
    # Retrieve user data using the user_id parameter
    return f'User ID: {user_id}'
```

## Utilizing Flask Templates and Static Files
### Flask Templates
- Flask supports templates using Jinja2, a powerful and feature-rich template engine. Templates allow developers to create dynamic HTML pages by injecting data from the server into the HTML.

Example:
```python
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/greet/<name>')
def greet(name):
    return render_template('greet.html', name=name)
```

### Static Files in Flask
- Flask can serve static files, such as CSS, JavaScript, and images, by placing them in a folder named "static" within the project directory.

Example:
```html
<!-- greet.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Greeting Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles.css') }}">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='avatar.png') }}" alt="User Avatar">
</body>
</html>
```

## Tips for writing a code with python

1. Modular Code Structure: Divide your code into modules or files based on their functionality. For example, you can have separate files for utility functions, database interactions, API routes, and business logic. This makes it easier to manage and understand different parts of the application.

2. Create `utils.py` for Utility Functions:

- Create a `utils.py` file to store utility functions that are used across different parts of your application.

- Example utils.py:
```python
# utils.py
def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def generate_random_string(length):
    # Code to generate a random string of the specified length
    pass
```
- Import and use the utility functions in other parts of the application:

```python
# other_module.py
from utils import calculate_average

data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
average = calculate_average(data)
```
3. Create `db.py`` for Database Interactions:

- Create a `db.py`` file to handle database-related operations like connecting to the database, querying, and updating data.

- Example db.py:
```python
# db.py
import sqlite3

def connect_to_database():
    # Code to establish a connection to the database
    pass

def execute_query(query, params=None):
    # Code to execute a database query with optional parameters
    pass

def get_user_by_id(user_id):
    # Code to retrieve a user from the database by their ID
    pass
```

- Import and use the database functions in other parts of the application:
```python
# other_module.py
from db import connect_to_database, get_user_by_id

# Connect to the database
db_conn = connect_to_database()

# Get a user by ID
user_id = 1
user = get_user_by_id(user_id)
```

4. **Avoid Global Variables**: Minimize the use of global variables as they can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code harder to maintain. Instead, pass data explicitly through function arguments or use class-based approaches for more complex scenarios.

```python
# Avoid this:
my_variable = 10

def my_function():
    global my_variable
    my_variable += 1

# Prefer this:
def my_function(my_variable):
    return my_variable + 1

new_value = my_function(10)
```

5. **Use Classes for Complex Logic**: For more complex business logic or operations that involve multiple functions and states, consider organizing them into classes. Classes can provide a cleaner and more structured way to manage complex backend logic.

```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y

    def subtract(self, x, y):
        return x - y

calc = Calculator()
result = calc.add(5, 3)  # Output: 8
```

6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent unexpected crashes. Use try, except, and finally blocks to catch and handle errors appropriately.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error: Division by zero.")
finally:
    print("Finally block executed.")
```

7. **Logging**: Use Python's built-in logging module to log relevant information, warnings, and errors. Proper logging helps in debugging and understanding the application's behavior during runtime.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

logging.debug('Debug message')
logging.info('Info message')
logging.warning('Warning message')
logging.error('Error message')
logging.critical('Critical message')
```

8. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for your backend code using Python's built-in unittest or third-party testing frameworks like pytest. Testing ensures that your code behaves as expected and allows for easier refactoring without breaking existing functionality.

```python
# my_math.py
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# test_my_math.py
import unittest
from my_math import add

class TestMyMath(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(3, 5), 8)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

9. **Virtual Environments**: Use virtual environments (e.g., venv or virtualenv) to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects. Virtual environments allow you to manage package versions and dependencies more effectively.

```python
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate   # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install flask
```

10. **Documentation**: Add meaningful comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and usage of functions, classes, and modules. Proper documentation makes it easier for other developers (including your future self) to understand the codebase.

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Parameters:
        numbers (list): A list of numerical values.

    Returns:
        float: The average value.
    """
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

# Building a simple server-side application

## Introduction to Server-Side Application Development
### Definition and Purpose
**Server-side applications** are programs that run on the server and handle client requests, process data, and generate responses. They provide the core functionality and business logic for web applications.

## Setting Up the Project
### Create a New Project Directory
- Create a new directory for the project to keep all files organized.

### Initialize a New Project
- Depending on the chosen technology, initialize a new project with the appropriate tools and package manager (e.g., npm init, pipenv, bundle init).

## Building the Server-Side Application with Python Flask (Example)
### Install Flask
- Use the package manager (pip or pipenv) to install Flask.

### Create a Simple Flask Application
- Create a new Python file (e.g., app.py) and import Flask.
- Define a route to handle HTTP GET requests to the root path ('/') and send a response.

Example `app.py`:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, Flask!'
```

### Run the Flask Server
- In the terminal, run python app.py to start the Flask server.

### Access the Server
- Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 (assuming the server is running on the default port 5000). You should see the message "Hello, Flask!" displayed.

## Adding the "Adding Friend" Feature (Example)
### Implement the "Adding Friend" Route
- Define a route to handle HTTP POST requests to add a friend and return a success message.

Example `app.py`:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

friends = []

@app.route('/add_friend', methods=['POST'])
def add_friend():
    data = request.json
    friend_name = data.get('name')

    if friend_name:
        friends.append(friend_name)
        return jsonify({'message': f'{friend_name} added as a friend.'})
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Name not provided.'}), 400
```

### Test the "Adding Friend" Feature
- Use a tool like curl or Postman to send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/add_friend with a JSON payload containing the friend's name.
- The server will respond with a success message if the friend is added successfully.

## Authorizing Users with Bearer Token (Example)
### Install Required Libraries
- Install the required libraries, such as Flask-HTTPAuth, to implement token-based authentication.

### Create an Authentication Endpoint
- Define a route to handle user login and issue a Bearer token upon successful authentication.

Example `app.py`:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_httpauth import HTTPBasicAuth, HTTPTokenAuth

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = HTTPBasicAuth()
token_auth = HTTPTokenAuth(scheme='Bearer')

# In a real-world scenario, usernames and passwords should be stored securely.
users = {
    "john": "password123"
}

@auth.verify_password
def verify_password(username, password):
    if username in users and users[username] == password:
        return username

@app.route('/login')
@auth.login_required
def login():
    token = auth.current_user()
    return jsonify({'token': token})

@app.route('/protected')
@token_auth.login_required
def protected_resource():
    return jsonify({'message': 'This is a protected resource.'})
```

### Test Token-Based Authentication
- Send a GET request to http://localhost:5000/login with Basic Auth credentials (username and password).
- The server will respond with a Bearer token.
- Use the received token to access the protected resource by sending a GET request to http://localhost:5000/protected with the token in the Authorization header (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <your_token>).

## Authentication techniques

Authentication is a crucial aspect of web applications, ensuring that users are who they claim to be. There are various types of authentication techniques, each with its own strengths and use cases. Here are some common authentication techniques with examples:

1. Basic Authentication:

- Basic authentication involves sending the username and password in the HTTP request headers, encoded in Base64.
- It is simple but not secure as the credentials are transmitted as plaintext.
- Example using Python's requests library:
```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

url = 'https://api.example.com/data'
response = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth('username', 'password'))
```

2. Token-Based Authentication:

- Token-based authentication involves issuing a token to a user upon successful login. The token is then sent with each subsequent request to authenticate the user.
- The token is typically a long, random string, and it can be stored in local storage, session storage, or as an HTTP-only cookie in the browser.
- Example using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with Python's Flask-JWT-Extended library:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required, create_access_token

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'
jwt = JWTManager(app)

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.json.get('username')
    password = request.json.get('password')

    # Perform authentication and verify credentials
    if verify_credentials(username, password):
        access_token = create_access_token(identity=username)
        return jsonify(access_token=access_token), 200
    else:
        return jsonify(message='Invalid credentials'), 401

@app.route('/protected', methods=['GET'])
@jwt_required()
def protected_resource():
    return jsonify(message='This is a protected resource.'), 200
```

3. OAuth 2.0:

- OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework used to grant limited access to a user's resources on one website to another website without sharing the user's credentials.
- It is commonly used for third-party applications to access user data without requiring the user's username and password.
- Example using OAuth 2.0 with Google Sign-In:

```python
<!-- Include Google Sign-In library -->
<script src="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js" async defer></script>

<!-- Sign-in button -->
<div class="g-signin2" data-onsuccess="onSignIn" data-theme="dark"></div>

<!-- JavaScript callback function -->
<script>
function onSignIn(googleUser) {
    // Get the user's Google ID token
    var id_token = googleUser.getAuthResponse().id_token;
    // Send the token to the server for validation and authentication
    // (Server-side validation is necessary to ensure the token is valid)
    $.post('/google-login', { token: id_token }, function(response) {
        console.log(response);
    });
}
</script>
```

4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

- MFA involves using multiple authentication methods to verify a user's identity. It provides an extra layer of security.
- Common MFA methods include something the user knows (password), something the user has (smartphone for SMS or authentication app), and something the user is (fingerprint or face recognition).
- Example using SMS-based MFA:

```python
import boto3
import random

# Function to generate and send a verification code via SMS using AWS SNS
def send_verification_code(phone_number):
    sns = boto3.client('sns', region_name='us-east-1')  # Replace 'us-east-1' with your desired AWS region
    verification_code = str(random.randint(100000, 999999))
    
    message = f'Your verification code is: {verification_code}'
    sns.publish(PhoneNumber=phone_number, Message=message)

    return verification_code

# Function to verify the code provided by the user
def verify_code(phone_number, code):
    # Assuming you have stored the verification code somewhere for validation
    # You can use a database, cache, or even a global variable in a real application
    stored_code = '123456'  # Replace this with the actual stored code
    return code == stored_code

# Example usage
phone_number = '+1234567890'  # Replace this with the user's phone number

# Step 1: Send the verification code via SMS
verification_code = send_verification_code(phone_number)
print(f'Verification code sent to {phone_number}: {verification_code}')

# Step 2: User provides the verification code
user_provided_code = input('Enter the verification code received: ')

# Step 3: Verify the code provided by the user
if verify_code(phone_number, user_provided_code):
    print('Verification successful. User is authenticated.')
else:
    print('Verification failed. Invalid code.')

```
