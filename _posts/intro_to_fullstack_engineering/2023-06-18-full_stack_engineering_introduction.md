Full Stack Software Engineering for Beginners

***

# Course Description

The Full Stack Software Engineering course is designed for individuals with little to no prior experience in software engineering who are eager to learn the skills necessary to become proficient in full stack development. Over the span of 10 weeks, this course will provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts, tools, and technologies required to build modern web applications.

Through a combination of hands-on projects, lectures, and interactive discussions, students will gain practical experience in both frontend and backend development. Starting from the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, students will gradually progress to building dynamic web applications using popular frameworks and libraries.

The curriculum covers essential topics such as server-client architecture, databases, version control, deployment strategies, performance optimization, and security best practices. By the end of the course, students will have developed a solid foundation in software engineering principles and will be able to design, develop, and deploy full stack applications.

# Course Outline

Week 1: Introduction to software engineering and web development 

Week 2: HTML and CSS fundamentals

Week 3: JavaScript basics and DOM manipulation

Week 4: Introduction to backend development with Node.js and Express.js

Week 5: Integrating frontend and backend using APIs

Week 6: Introduction to front-end frameworks

Week 7: Databases and SQL fundamentals

Week 8: Authentication and authorization in web applications

Week 9: Deployment strategies and performance optimization

Week 10: Introduction to DevOps and final project


# Prerequisites
No prior knowledge of software engineering or web development is required for this course. However, students should have a basic understanding of computer literacy and be comfortable with using a computer and browsing the internet. Familiarity with any programming language would be beneficial but is not mandatory.

# Course Benefits
Upon completion of the Full Stack Software Engineering course, students will achieve the following key learning outcomes:
