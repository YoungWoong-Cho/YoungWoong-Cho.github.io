# JavaScript functions and control flow

## Introduction to Functions

### Definition and Purpose

Functions in JavaScript are reusable **blocks of code that perform specific tasks**. They encapsulate a series of instructions and can accept **input parameters** and return **output values**. Functions allow for code modularity, organization, and reusability, enhancing the readability and maintainability of JavaScript programs.

### Function Declaration and Invocation

In JavaScript, functions can be declared using the `function` keyword followed by a function name, parameter list, and code block. Functions can be invoked (called) by using the function name followed by parentheses. The parameters represent values that can be passed into the function when invoking it.

### Return Statement

Functions can return values using the `return` statement. When a function encounters a `return` statement, it stops executing and returns the specified value. The return value can be assigned to a variable or used directly in code.

### Examples
Example 1:
```javascript
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
// Function invocation
greet("John"); // Output: "Hello, John!"
```

Example 2:
```javascript
// Function declaration with return statement
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Function invocation and assigning the return value
let result = add(5, 3); // result will be 8
```

## Control Flow Statements

### Conditional Statements (`if...else` and `switch`)

**Conditional statements** allow us to make decisions in our code based on certain conditions. The `if...else` statement and `switch` statement are commonly used for conditional branching.

### Looping Statements (`for`, `while`, and `do...while`)

Looping statements enable us to repeat a block of code multiple times. JavaScript provides different loop constructs, including `for`, `while`, and `do...while`.

### Examples

Example 1: Conditional Statements
```javascript
let x = 10;

if (x > 0) {
  console.log("Positive number");
} else if (x < 0) {
  console.log("Negative number");
} else {
  console.log("Zero");
}

let day = "Tuesday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
      console.log("It's Monday!");
      break;
  case "Tuesday":
      console.log("It's Tuesday!");
      break;
  default:
      console.log("It's another day!");
}
```

Example 2: Looping Statements
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

let j = 0;
do {
  console.log(j);
  j++;
} while (j < 5);
```
## Scope and Hoisting

### Function Scope and Block Scope

JavaScript has **function scope**, meaning variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function. However, the introduction of `let` and `const` keywords in modern JavaScript introduced **block scope**, allowing variables to be scoped within blocks (e.g., if statements, loops) as well.

The main difference between `const` and `let` in JavaScript lies in their behavior regarding reassignment and scope.

`const`:
- Variables declared with `const` are **block-scoped** and cannot be reassigned once they are assigned a value. The value assigned to a `const` variable remains constant throughout the execution of the program.
- It is important to note that `const` does not make objects or arrays immutable. While the binding of the variable cannot change, the properties or elements of the object or array can still be modified.
- The use of `const` is recommended for values that are not intended to be reassigned, providing immutability and making the code more robust and predictable.

`let`:
- Variables declared with `let` are also **block-scoped**, but they can be reassigned with a new value. This allows for the variable's value to change during the execution of the program.
- Unlike `var`, which has function scope, `let` has block scope. This means that a `let` variable is limited in visibility to the block in which it is defined, such as within a loop or an if statement.
- `let` is suitable for situations where the value of a variable needs to be reassigned or modified.

The var keyword was the traditional way to declare variables in JavaScript before the introduction of let and const. However, there are some important differences between var and the newer keywords.

`var`:
- Variables declared with `var` are **function-scoped**. This means that their visibility is limited to the function in which they are defined. If a `var` variable is declared outside of any function, it becomes a *global variable* accessible throughout the entire program.
- `var` variables are **hoisted**, meaning their declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This allows `var` variables to be used before they are declared, although their initial value will be `undefined`.
- Unlike `const` and `let`, `var` does not have block scope. Variables declared with `var` are accessible throughout the whole function or, if declared globally, throughout the whole program.
`var` variables can be reassigned and their values can be modified.

### Hoisting

**Hoisting** is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. It means that variables and functions can be used before they are declared.

For a more detailed explanation, see this [link](https://hanamon.kr/javascript-%ED%98%B8%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%ED%8C%85%EC%9D%B4%EB%9E%80-hoisting/).

C. Examples
Example 1: Function Scope and Block Scope
```javascript
function example() {
  if (true) {
      var functionScopeVar = "Function scope variable";
      let blockScopeVar = "Block scope variable";
  }
  console.log(functionScopeVar); // Accessible
  console.log(blockScopeVar); // ReferenceError: blockScopeVar is not defined
}
```

Example 2: Hoisting
```javascript
console.log(hoistedVariable); // Output: undefined
var hoistedVariable = "I am hoisted!";

hoistedFunction(); // Output: "I am a hoisted function"
function hoistedFunction() {
  console.log("I am a hoisted function");
}

// Note: if hoistedVariable is declared with const or let, the program will crash.
```

# Introduction to version control with Git

## Introduction to Version Control

### Definition and Purpose

**Version control** is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing multiple contributors to collaborate on a project effectively. It provides a structured approach to track modifications, manage different versions, and facilitate collaboration among developers. Version control systems offer benefits such as backup, history tracking, code review, and seamless team collaboration.

### Centralized vs. Distributed Version Control

**Centralized version control systems** (e.g., Subversion) have a central repository where all the files and their history are stored. **Distributed version control systems** (e.g., Git) create a local repository on each user's machine, enabling them to work independently and efficiently without relying on a centralized server.

## Introduction to Git

### Definition and Features

Git is a popular distributed version control system widely used in software development. It provides a decentralized and efficient approach to managing code repositories. Git offers features such as speed, scalability, branching, merging, and easy collaboration.

### Git Terminology

Understanding key Git terminology is essential for working effectively with the system. Some important terms include repository, commit, branch, merge, remote, and clone.

### Git Workflow
Git follows a typical workflow that involves creating a repository, making changes to files, staging the changes, committing them, and optionally pushing the commits to a remote repository. The workflow encourages frequent commits and facilitates collaboration among team members.

## Getting Started with Git

### Installation and Configuration

To start using Git, you need to install it on your machine and configure your username and email. This information is associated with the commits you make.

### Initializing a Git Repository

To start tracking changes in a project, you can initialize a Git repository in the project's root directory using the `git init` command. This creates a `.git` folder that holds the repository's metadata.

### Basic Git Commands

- `git status`: Shows the current status of the repository, including modified files, untracked files, and branch information.
- `git add`: Stages changes for commit. You can add specific files (`git add <filename>`) or all modified files (`git add .`).
- `git commit`: Creates a new commit to save changes. It is recommended to provide a meaningful commit message (`git commit -m "Your message"`).
- `git log`: Displays a chronological list of commits, including commit hashes, authors, timestamps, and messages.

## Collaborating with Git

### Working with Remote Repositories

Git enables collaboration by allowing developers to work on the same project from different machines. You can clone remote repositories, fetch changes, push your commits, and pull changes made by others.

### Branching and Merging
Git's branching and merging capabilities enable developers to work on separate branches, isolate changes, and later integrate them into the main codebase. Branches provide an efficient way to manage parallel development and feature implementation.

### Resolving Conflicts
When multiple developers make conflicting changes, Git highlights the conflicts during merges. Resolving conflicts involves manually editing the conflicting files and choosing the desired changes.

## Examples
Example 1: Initializing a Git Repository
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/repository/.git/
```

Example 2: Basic Workflow with Git

```
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git log
```

Example 3: Cloning a Remote Repository

```
$ git clone <remote-url>
```

Example 4: Creating and Merging Branches

```
$ git branch feature/new-feature
$ git checkout feature/new-feature
$ git commit -m "Implement new feature"
$ git checkout main
$ git merge feature/new-feature
```
