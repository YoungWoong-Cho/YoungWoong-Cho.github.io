# Introduction
> Our project began with a question, *"what if inorganic things **'decay'**, like organic things?"*

The importance of **sustainable design** is increasing. Through deep convolutional neural network, we imagined the world where **everything is organic, and thus perishes**.

A deep neural network was trained to **predict the "decayed" appearance of an arbitrary input image**. A dataset that consists of several hundred images of fresh/rotten apples, oranges, and bananas were used to train the neural network. **pix2pix**, **CycleGAN**, and **DiscoGAN** were considered as our neural network model, and **CycleGAN was found to perform the best**.

## Decay, in Biology
The word **decay** nearly instinctively gives a negative impression, because it is usually associated with death. After an organic body goes through death, it biodegrades, or less formally, decays. The decomposers, such as fungi or bacteria, break down the organic body, changing it into an inorganic matter and blending it back in with the earth.

The physical and chemical properties of the dead organism change as it decays. As a result, the appearance becomes drastically different after an organic matter decays. The colors might change from vivid to dull; dark moles might appear; cavities with varying sizes might be created as well.

## Decay and sustainability
However, humankind nowadays are rather more concerned of materials that do not decay — for example, plastics. According to [Plastic Soup Foundation](https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/en/plastic-problem/plastic-environment/plastic-production-decomposition/), *plastic is non-biodegradable*.

> *Plastic does not decompose. This means that all plastic that has ever been produced and has ended up in the environment is still present there in one form or another.*

This is the reason why **sustainable design** is gaining popularity lately. Man-made products, after some time, must consider the environmental impact.  Biodegradable plastics are one of such attempts.

## Decay, and Neural network
Through deep convolutional neural network, we imagined the world where everything is organic, and thus perishes. We trained a cycleGAN model, a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), that predicts the "decayed" appearance of any arbitrary input images — a tennis ball, a rubber duck. etc.

# Process
## Problem definition
The goal of the project is to design and build a neural network model that is capable of translating the image input $I \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times H \times W}$ to an image output $O \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times H \times W}$, where $H$ and $W$ are the height and the width of the image, respectively.

## Dataset
The dataset taken from "[**Fruits fresh and rotten for classification**](https://www.kaggle.com/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification)" consists of train and test sets of **fresh and rotten images of apple, banana, and orange**. Take a look at **table 1** for the number of images for each class.

| Fruit type |Fresh/Rotten|Number of images|
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- |
|    Apple   |   Fresh    |      1693      |
|            |   Rotten   |      2342      |
|    Banana  |   Fresh    |      1581      |
|            |   Rotten   |      2224      |
|    Orange  |   Fresh    |      1466      |
|            |   Rotten   |      1595      |
**Table 1 (a).** Number of images of each fruit type of the training dataset.

| Fruit type |Fresh/Rotten|Number of images|
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- |
|    Apple   |   Fresh    |       395      |
|            |   Rotten   |       601      |
|    Banana  |   Fresh    |       381      |
|            |   Rotten   |       530      |
|    Orange  |   Fresh    |       388      |
|            |   Rotten   |       403      |

## Model selection
There are various neural network architecture that can carry out the task of **image-to-image translation**. We have narrowed down the candidates into three: **pix2pix**, **DIicoGAN**, and **CycleGAN**.

### Pix2pix
Our first consideration was [pix2pix](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf).

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/2021-02-01-Decay/pix2pix.png" alt="this is a placeholder image">
  <figcaption><b>Figure 4.</b> An image snippet from pix2pix paper.</figcaption>
</figure>

However, it was not successful, since pix2pix required a set of **paired dataset**. It was almost impossible to prepare several hundreds of fresh-rotten pair of images.

### DiscoGAN
Our next consideration was [DiscoGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05192.pdf). It was chosen since it not only could take in **unpaired dataset** but also was capable of performing **geometry change**. Since an apple, an orange, or a banana goes through a morphological change when rotten, DiscoGAN seemed to be a good choice.

Following figure shows the resulting images after **50 epochs of training** with apple2rotten dataset, which consists of 184 images of fresh apple and 271 images of rotten apple.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/2021-02-01-Decay/discoGAN.png" alt="this is a placeholder image">
  <figcaption><b>Figure 5.</b> Images generated during the training of the model.</figcaption>
</figure>

`0.A.jpg` is the **original image** of an apple, `0.AB.jpg` is the image that is **mapped to the domain of rotten apple**, and `0.ABA.jpg` is the **reconstructed image**, which is mapped back to the original domain. As it can be seen, the translated image(`0.AB.jpg`) not only shows the change in colors but also in its contours.

However, the transformation was **not** performing well at all for the images that are **not apples**. Take a look at following transformations.

</figure>

When the model attempts to convert a non-apple image into an apple image, it tries to **force** to translate the image into an apple; thus, drastic failure.

### CycleGAN
Our next consideration was [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) because it could preserve the **geometric characteristics** of the input image while being capable of handling the unpaired dataset.

Following figures show the resulting images after **200 epochs of training** with banana2rotten dataset, which consists of 342 images of fresh banana and 484 images of rotten banana.<br>

</figure>

It seems working! However, since our dataset mostly consists of banana, the model performed well only for the *yellow* images. Therefore, we decided to train the model using *all images of the fruits* - apples, oranges, and bananas altogether, so that our model can be ready for more diverse colors.

Following image shows some of the resulting images generated by the model while being trained.

  <figcaption><b>Figure 8.</b> Inference of the cycleGAN trained with all fruit2rotten image dataset. Not only the yellow but also the red and orange colors are being translated well.</figcaption>
</figure>

It can be seen that the model is trained to translate the images of red, yellow, orange, and green.

# Result
Following images are generated by our model that is trained to predict the decay of the input image.

The model is trained with 505 images of fresh fruits, and 690 images of rotten fruits. It was trained for 200 epochs.
