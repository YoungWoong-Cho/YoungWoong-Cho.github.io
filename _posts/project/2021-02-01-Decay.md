# Introduction
> Our project began with a question, *"what if inorganic things **'decay'**, like organic things?"*

The importance of **sustainable design** is increasing. Through deep convolutional neural network, we imagined the world where **everything is organic, and thus perishes**.

A deep neural network was trained to **predict the "decayed" appearance of an arbitrary input image**. A dataset that consists of several hundred images of fresh/rotten apples, oranges, and bananas were used to train the neural network. **pix2pix**, **CycleGAN**, and **DiscoGAN** were considered as our neural network model, and **CycleGAN was found to perform the best**.

## Decay, in Biology
The word **decay** nearly instinctively gives a negative impression, because it is usually associated with death. After an organic body goes through death, it biodegrades, or less formally, decays. The decomposers, such as fungi or bacteria, break down the organic body, changing it into an inorganic matter and blending it back in with the earth.

The physical and chemical properties of the dead organism change as it decays. As a result, the appearance becomes drastically different after an organic matter decays. The colors might change from vivid to dull; dark moles might appear; cavities with varying sizes might be created as well.

## Decay and sustainability
However, humankind nowadays are rather more concerned of materials that do not decay — for example, plastics. According to [Plastic Soup Foundation](https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/en/plastic-problem/plastic-environment/plastic-production-decomposition/), *plastic is non-biodegradable*.

> *Plastic does not decompose. This means that all plastic that has ever been produced and has ended up in the environment is still present there in one form or another.*

This is the reason why **sustainable design** is gaining popularity lately. Man-made products, after some time, must consider the environmental impact.  Biodegradable plastics are one of such attempts.

## Decay, and Neural network
Through deep convolutional neural network, we imagined the world where everything is organic, and thus perishes. We trained a cycleGAN model, a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), that predicts the "decayed" appearance of any arbitrary input images — a tennis ball, a rubber duck. etc.

# Process
## Dataset
The dataset taken from "[**Fruits fresh and rotten for classification**](https://www.kaggle.com/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification)" consists of train and test sets of **fresh and rotten images of apple, banana, and orange**. Take a look at **table 1** for the number of images for each class.

| Fruit type |Fresh/Rotten|Number of images|
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- |
|    Apple   |   Fresh    |      1693      |
|            |   Rotten   |      2342      |
|    Banana  |   Fresh    |      1581      |
|            |   Rotten   |      2224      |
|    Orange  |   Fresh    |      1466      |
|            |   Rotten   |      1595      |
**Table 1 (a).** Number of images of each fruit type of the training dataset.

| Fruit type |Fresh/Rotten|Number of images|
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- |
|    Apple   |   Fresh    |       395      |
|            |   Rotten   |       601      |
|    Banana  |   Fresh    |       381      |
|            |   Rotten   |       530      |
|    Orange  |   Fresh    |       388      |
|            |   Rotten   |       403      |
