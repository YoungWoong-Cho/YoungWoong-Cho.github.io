	<h2>Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression</h2>
	<h6>July 2020</h6><br/>
	<p>In this project, three different types of linear regression methods are performed: plain linear regression with no regularization, ridge regression with regularization, and lasso regression. After
the models were trained, their performances were quantitatively analyzed by the MSE values on
the validation datasets.</p>

	<h2>Simulation of a drone with a slingload using rotating body frame</h2>
	<h6>Spring 2020</h6><br/>
	<p>Helicopters are often employed to lift heavy external loads and drop them off in hard to reach areas. In the external loading configuration, the cargo is slung under the helicopter by cargo hooks then dropped off at the desired location. Typical sling loads are bluff bodies which are susceptible to aerodynamic instability. In particular, at high forward airspeeds, sling loads are subjected to yawing oscillations and / or complete rotations, which are often coupled with lateral oscillations (called swaying motion) of increasing or non-decreasing amplitude.<br>
	In the Spring 2020 session of ME363, we began studying a simplified version of this problem. We examined an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle carrying a sling load with no aerodynamic coupling. The objectives of the semester was to develop mathematical models that describe the system dynamics and implement Python programs that simulate the motion of the system under different scenarios.<br>
	Our work this semester will serve as the foundation for our summer investigation of more complicated drone-load systems. Furthermore, our scripts will allow us to make more realistic models with more complex operating conditions. Possible applications of the models include collaborative drone systems and comparison of how the loaded sling may behave and fail if it were to be modeled as elastic versus inelastic.</p>
