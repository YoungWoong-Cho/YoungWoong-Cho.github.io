	<h2>Autonomous Mobile Robots</h2>
	<h6>Fall 2020</h6><br/>
	<p>An autonomous mobile robot was designed for the fall 2020 ME412 Autonomous Mobile Robots course in the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.</p>
	<p>The robot is designed to accomplish several tasks while operating autonomously in an unknown environment. The robot is expected to navigate through a dirt/gravel surface while detecting and avoiding obstacles such as large rocks and bonsai of various sizes.<br>
	The ultimate goal of the robot is to attack enemy robots by launching a ping pong ball “warhead” or slot a ping pong ball “warhead” in a circular cavity located on an enemy home base, after which the robot would return to its own home base.<br>
	The robot is equipped with various sensors, including ultrasonic sonar sensors, infrared sensors, limit switches, and LIDAR. It also has four DC motors that control translational and rotational movement, two servo motors to carry out object slotting tasks, and a solenoid to launch a ping pong ball “warhead.”<br>
	The robot is controlled with an Arduino Mega 2560, which is used to read sensors’ signal inputs and actuate motors and a solenoid with the help of a L293D motor driver shield.</p>

	<h2>PID control of an inverse pendulum</h2>
	<h6>Summer 2020</h6><br/>
	<p>PID controller is one of the most vastly utilized feedback controller. In this project, a four wheeled vehicle is controlled using PID approach in order to keep a robot arm with a revolute joint in vertical position. This project is still on process.</p>

	<h2>Simulation of a drone with a slingload using rotating body frame</h2>
	<h6>Spring 2020</h6><br/>
	<p>Helicopters are often employed to lift heavy external loads and drop them off in hard to reach areas. In the external loading configuration, the cargo is slung under the helicopter by cargo hooks then dropped off at the desired location. Typical sling loads are bluff bodies which are susceptible to aerodynamic instability. In particular, at high forward airspeeds, sling loads are subjected to yawing oscillations and / or complete rotations, which are often coupled with lateral oscillations (called swaying motion) of increasing or non-decreasing amplitude.<br>
	In the Spring 2020 session of ME363, we began studying a simplified version of this problem. We examined an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle carrying a sling load with no aerodynamic coupling. The objectives of the semester was to develop mathematical models that describe the system dynamics and implement Python programs that simulate the motion of the system under different scenarios.<br>
	Our work this semester will serve as the foundation for our summer investigation of more complicated drone-load systems. Furthermore, our scripts will allow us to make more realistic models with more complex operating conditions. Possible applications of the models include collaborative drone systems and comparison of how the loaded sling may behave and fail if it were to be modeled as elastic versus inelastic.</p>
