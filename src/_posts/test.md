# Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors
- Scalars
  - Just a single number.
  - ex) $s \in \mathbb{R}$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$
- Vectors
  - An array of numbers.
  - ex) $\bm{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
- Matrices
  - A 2-D array of numbers.
  - ex) $\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$
- Tensors
  - An array with more than two axes.

- Transpose

  - A transpose of a column vector is a row vector, and vice versa.
  - A transpose of a scalar is itself.
